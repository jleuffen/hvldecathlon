<p> Born Jared Reading Leuffen, he is the youngest child of Eric and Deborah Leuffen. He has an older sister, Kendall Leuffen and a dog, Maggie.
Like Hinkle, Jared also grew up on the legendary Steeplechase Drive in Reading, PA. In his youth, he was also a member of the three Jared's that
grew up on Steeplechase. As he got older, he began to hang out and become close with both the other Jared's, as well as another Steeplechase legend, Dylan Evanish.
He enjoyed playing almost any sport with the neighborhood kids, including pickup basketball, and wiffleball. As he grew up, he developed many nicknames to distinguish
himself from the other Jared's, including J Leuff, Leuff Dawg, or simply Leuffen. He would go on to attend school in the Exeter School District for his
entire early school career.

8% of his class. After many college visits and many tough decisions, Leuffen decided to attend the University of Pittsburgh, where he currently is today.
